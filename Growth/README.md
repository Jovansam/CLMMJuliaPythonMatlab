# 7 Solution Methods

This README file describes the instructions to replicate the results from Coleman Lyon Maliar Maliar (?).

## Generate sequence of shocks

The code in all three languages will ultimately simulate using the same sequence of shocks in order to make the euler errors comparable. Once Python (and the package `numpy`) are installed (for instructions to do this, see Quantitative Economic's [Getting Started](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/getting_started.html) lecture), then you simply need to run the command `python gen_shocks.py`. This will generate 10200 random numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution and save to a file named `EE_SHOCKS.csv`.

This procedure has been run and the file already exists, though we keep the original shock generation routines here for reproducibility.

## Generate Results

Below are instructions for generating the language specific output for table 1 and 2.

Note: Make sure you have generated the shocks using the command from the previous section (`python gen_shocks.py`)

### Julia

You should enter the `julia` directory -- `cd julia` from the terminal...

Once you are in the correct directory, make sure you have the correct packages. Run the following command in a julia terminal

```
using Pkg
pkg"activate ."
pkg"instantiate"
```

Then the results can be generated by running `julia --project=@. -L main.jl -e "main()"`. The results will be stored in a filed called `METHODSLOG.log`.

### Matlab

Start Matlab in the `MATLABCode` directory. Can generate the times and Euler errors for any method by running `Main_7_Methods.m`. In order to choose a method, you should change the variable `Method` on line 50. It should be set to:


* 1 - envelope condition method iterating on value function (ECM-VF)
* 2 - conventional value function interation (VFI)
* 3 - endogenous grid method (EGM)
* 4 - policy function iteration via envelope condition (ECM-PI)
* 5 - conventional policy function iteration via FOC (PI)
* 6 - envelope condition method iterating on derivative of value function (ECM-DVF)
* 7 - conventional Euler equation method (EE)

To generate all the results you can run the script `gen_results` from the `MATLABCode` directory. A diary file will be written to `METHODSLOG.log`


### Python

You should enter the `python` directory -- `cd python` from the terminal...

Once you are in the correct directory, make sure you have the correct packages. In addition to the packages included with Anaconda, you should run the following commands in terminal to get two additional packages

```
pip install quantecon
pip install git+https://github.com/EconForge/interpolation.py.git
```

Then the results can be generated by running `python main.py`. The results will be stored in a filed called `METHODSLOG.log`.
